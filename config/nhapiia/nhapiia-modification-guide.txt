Steps to modify Nhia/Napiia from sas code:
1. Read the sas code and the change document (if any) and apply them to NhiaUtils and NapiiaUtils.
2. Usually since the data (name and hispanic percentage) also changed, get the new version of sas export file (.xpt).
3. Then copy the printformat.sas code in this project folder and and the xpt folder to home folder (eg H://Napiia)
4. Edit the sas code to modify the xpt file and the lst output file location.
5. Run the sas code (sas printformat.sas)
6. You will get the lst file, which has all the name, county hispanic percentage data.
7. Then there is a java class NhapiiaFormatsLab under test/java/lab. Run this class's main method to get those nhia and napiia csv files under main/resources/tools.
   (You may need to change the formats name (tables name) if it is changed in saS, like ($PCT_HSP was converted to $PCT10_HSP) in 2013/09/12)
8. Create a new folder under config/nhapiia and save the xpt, lst and sas code.
